        I am an aspiring research scientist exploring the molecular intersections of basic biology and translational medicine, with a passion for turning discoveries into therapies. I am particularly interested in entering the pharmaceutical and biotech realms to continue bridging mechanistic studies with applied research. Beyond the bench, I am committed to making science accessible through mentorship, teaching, and communication, fostering curiosity, innovation, and inclusion in the scientific community.
