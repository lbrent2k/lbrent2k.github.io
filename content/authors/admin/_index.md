I am a senior honors student at UC Santa Barbara, majoring in Molecular & Cellular Biology (Microbiology emphasis, GPA 3.99), currently applying to PhD programs. My research integrates evolutionary theory and cancer genomics, with active contributions to academic panels, mentorship, and scientific presentation at national conferences. Recent projects span cancer genetics at NIH, drug development at BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, and comparative genomics in the Boddy Lab.
