## About the Project

As a research assistant in Dr. Amy Boddy’s lab at UC Santa Barbara (Goleta, CA), I examine how placental morphology shapes mammalian reproductive strategies.

- Curated a large dataset (648 species, 23 orders) on placental types and life history traits.
- Developed and implemented MATLAB scripts for comparative analyses and visualization.
- Uncovered evolutionary trade-offs linking placental invasiveness with gestation length.
- Results reconcile previous conflicting findings, leveraging a broader, phylogenetically controlled dataset.

## My Contribution

I assembled and organized the extensive placental trait dataset, then developed MATLAB programs to analyze and visualize links between placental morphology and reproductive strategy.

- Demonstrated that less invasive placentas correlate with longer gestation lengths.
- No support for predicted relationship between invasiveness and neonate size, offering nuanced evolutionary context.
- Led data visualization and analysis efforts; actively co-authoring the lab’s forthcoming manuscript.

## Publication & Presentation

We are drafting a manuscript:  
Parmeggiani, C., Forsythe, M., Boddy, M., et al. (2025). *Life-History Tradeoffs and Placental Evolution in Mammals: Maternal Investment Across the Tree of Life.*  
I presented a poster at the CWESS Research Conference and am further involved in the peer review process.
